# Political Impediments to Geothermal Energy Adoption: A Research Summary

**Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Research Scope:** Academic literature, government reports, and credible sources on political barriers to geothermal energy development

---

## Executive Summary

This research examines the political barriers hindering geothermal energy deployment globally, focusing on policy fragmentation, regulatory delays, lack of political will, fossil fuel lobbying influence, subsidy imbalances, and intergovernmental coordination challenges. Despite geothermal energy's potential as reliable, baseload renewable power, political and institutional barriers significantly impede its adoption relative to other renewable technologies.

## Key Themes

### 1. Regulatory Fragmentation and Permitting Delays

#### **Findings:**
Political and regulatory barriers represent one of the most significant impediments to geothermal development. The permitting process is characterized by:

- **Multiple jurisdictional layers:** Geothermal projects must navigate federal, state, and local regulations simultaneously, creating overlapping and often conflicting requirements
- **Extended timelines:** Research from NREL estimates that each final geothermal well on U.S. public land invokes NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) review up to six times, with each Environmental Assessment (EA) taking approximately 10 months, resulting in an **average development timeline of 8 years** (ClearPath, 2024)
- **Lack of centralized permitting:** The absence of a centralized permitting office at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) leads to duplicative environmental and regulatory assessments among local offices
- **Regulatory uncertainty:** Tim Latimer, CEO of Fervo Energy, described a common experience: "We submit all of the necessary paperwork, regulations, environmental impact assessments to the regulatory bodies, and it sits there for months and months and months, and we actually can't even get a response" (PERC, 2023)

**International Context:**
- **Japan:** Developers face overlapping jurisdictions, lengthy environmental reviews, and complex permitting processes that compound development challenges (Springer Nature, 2025)
- **General pattern:** Variation in policy frameworks across different jurisdictions creates inconsistent regulatory environments, making it challenging to navigate and secure funding for geothermal projects (Frontiers in Built Environment, 2025)

#### **Policy Implications:**
The **GeoVision Barriers Task Force Report** (NREL, 2019) identified regulatory, permitting, and land-access barriers as critical non-technical impediments requiring policy intervention. The report projects that streamlining permitting processes could decrease development timelines by 25-50% and increase geothermal capacity by as much as 15-20 times by 2050 (Third Way, 2025).

### 2. Lack of Political Will and Public Awareness

#### **Findings:**
Despite geothermal energy's advantages—including baseload capacity, small land footprint, and reliability—political support has lagged behind other renewable technologies:

- **Limited awareness:** There is a documented lack of public awareness and understanding of geothermal energy, including its availability as a renewable resource. This lack of awareness has likely contributed to the absence of federal and state policies supporting geothermal energy (ClearPath, 2024)
- **Policy neglect:** Many states in the eastern and southern United States did not have geothermal regulations for power production or direct-use applications as of 2019 (U.S. DOE, 2019)
- **Political uncertainty:** Despite recent bipartisan interest, "the future of geothermal remains mired in political uncertainty" (OilPrice.com, 2024)
- **Slow legislative action:** There is a recognized gap between the expanding body of research advocating for geothermal development and the limited legislative action taken by Congress (Niskanen Center, 2025)

#### **Recent Developments:**
Interestingly, geothermal has gained unusual bipartisan support due to its alignment with oil and gas industry expertise and infrastructure. As one analyst noted: "It's very oil- and gas-adjacent to transition to drilling for geothermal. It's a lot of the same industry, a lot of the same jobs, a lot of the same equipment" (Inside Climate News, 2026). This has led to some political momentum, including the **Geothermal Tax Parity Act of 2025** introduced by Representatives Garamendi and Maloy.

### 3. Fossil Fuel Lobbying and Industry Opposition

#### **Findings:**
The fossil fuel industry's substantial lobbying efforts create an uneven playing field for renewable energy technologies, including geothermal:

- **Lobbying expenditures:** In 2022, the oil and gas sector invested approximately **$124.4 million on federal lobbying efforts**, far exceeding renewable energy industry spending (Earth Day, 2024; OpenSecrets, 2023)
- **Comparative disadvantage:** The renewable energy industry, including geothermal, "often goes head-to-head with the oil and gas industry, which has historically spent far more on lobbying and political donations" (OpenSecrets, 2024)
- **Policy obstruction:** Oil and gas companies have actively lobbied against climate policies, renewable fuel standards, and regulations that would favor clean energy alternatives (InfluenceMap, 2019)
- **Undermining renewable targets:** Shell Oil Company began lobbying the United Kingdom government as early as 2011 to undermine European renewable energy targets (Wikipedia, 2026; The Guardian)

#### **Systemic Issues:**
- **Established political influence:** Fossil fuel industries with substantial political influence lobby for continued subsidies even when their technologies are mature, creating barriers to innovation and market entry for emerging technologies like enhanced geothermal systems
- **Divestment pressure:** An activist-led divestment movement has the potential to increase fossil fuel companies' vulnerability, potentially leading to renewed lobbying expenditures and more obstruction of climate change mitigation policies (ScienceDirect, 2023)

### 4. Subsidy Imbalances and Financial Inequities

#### **Findings:**
Geothermal energy faces significant financial disadvantages compared to fossil fuels due to long-standing subsidy structures:

- **Fossil fuel subsidies:** The IEA calculated that fossil fuels received approximately **$260 billion in subsidies in 2016**, and the UNFCCC has criticized these subsidies for hampering progress on reducing emissions (LSE Grantham Institute, 2024)
- **Late inclusion in support schemes:** Geothermal energy projects only became eligible for substantial federal subsidies with the **Inflation Reduction Act in 2022**, decades after fossil fuel subsidies were established (Resources for the Future, 2023)
- **Tax parity issues:** Despite geothermal's advantages, it "does not benefit from long-standing tax incentives that drive investment" available to other energy sources, leading to the introduction of the Geothermal Tax Parity Act (Rep. Garamendi, 2025)
- **Uneven playing field:** Subsidies for incumbent technologies like fossil fuels "can hinder innovation by creating an uneven playing field" where established industries maintain competitive advantages through political influence (PPL Renewable Energy, 2025)

#### **Cost Competitiveness:**
Despite subsidy imbalances, geothermal has shown economic promise:
- IRENA (2023) reported that geothermal's global weighted average LCOE reached USD 0.071/kWh in 2023, remaining competitive with fossil fuel-fired electricity
- IRENA (2024) data showed geothermal costs declined by 16% between 2023 and 2024
- Around 90% of renewable energy installations are now cheaper than fossil fuels worldwide (Reuters, 2025; IRENA, 2025)

### 5. Intergovernmental Coordination Issues

#### **Findings:**
Poor coordination among government agencies and across governance levels creates significant barriers to geothermal development:

- **Fragmented governance:** Developing countries often lack the right institutional framework and coordination among corresponding stakeholders (PMC, 2022)
- **Overlapping mandates:** Multi-stakeholder collaboration emerged as both a challenge and an asset, with respondents emphasizing the need for effective coordination among regulators, utilities, donors, and communities—particularly in contexts where overlapping mandates and fragmented governance are prevalent (MDPI, 2026)
- **Regional disparities:** Ethiopia and Tanzania were cited as settings where fragmented mandates impede progress, while Kenya was referenced as a positive example of consolidated governance (MDPI, 2026)
- **Lack of central coordination:** The permitting and licensing process for geothermal projects "can be complex and time-consuming, requiring coordination among various government agencies and stakeholders" (Number Analytics, 2024)

#### **International Coordination:**
- The **Global Geothermal Alliance (GGA)**, endorsed in 2016, was created to coordinate with existing structures, programs, and facilities that share the common objective of promoting geothermal energy deployment at international, regional, and national levels
- The International Energy Agency recommends that governments "promote international collaboration to develop technical standards for geothermal to address environmental concerns and enable scalability" (IEA, 2024)

### 6. International Comparison: Success Stories and Lessons

#### **Successful Models:**

**Kenya:**
- **Long-term institutional backing:** Kenya was repeatedly cited as an example where long-term institutional and political backing created momentum in the geothermal sector
- **Consolidated governance:** Kenya demonstrates consolidated governance structures that contrast favorably with fragmented systems in neighboring countries
- **Capacity building:** Kenya's success is attributed to "a local pool of people with skills and knowledge of geothermal energy" and strong government support (MDPI, 2026; Carnegie Endowment, 2025)
- **Scale:** Kenya's installed geothermal capacity stood at 676 MW in 2017, outpacing Japan, Iceland, and Costa Rica (ResearchGate, 2019)

**Iceland:**
- **Comprehensive framework:** Iceland developed the Geothermal Sustainability Assessment Protocol (GSAP) to ensure sustainable development, which has been tested and implemented in New Zealand and Kenya (MDPI, 2024)
- **Integrated planning:** Iceland's success stems from strong government support, commitment to sustainability, and integrated master planning for geothermal and hydropower development (Pálsson, 2012)

**Philippines:**
- **Policy framework:** The **Renewable Energy Act of 2008** provided fiscal incentives (tax exemptions, import duty relief) and non-fiscal provisions (feed-in tariffs, net-metering, renewable portfolio standards) that fostered a conducive environment for investment (Energy Tracker Asia, 2024)
- **Early leadership:** The Philippines was historically one of the world's leading producers of geothermal energy
- **Recent stagnation:** Despite the 2008 Act, development has slowed—only 86 MW was added between 2007 and 2023, and full implementation of the Act's provisions was realized a decade after enactment (Edge Davao, 2024; ScienceDirect, 2021)

#### **Common Success Factors:**
- **Clear political will and long-term commitment**
- **Consolidated institutional structures** (not fragmented)
- **Comprehensive legal frameworks** with both fiscal and non-fiscal incentives
- **Investment in workforce development and technical capacity**
- **Stable, predictable policy environments**

## Policy Analysis and Recommendations

### Critical Barriers Requiring Immediate Attention:

1. **Permitting Reform:**
   - Streamline NEPA processes for geothermal projects
   - Create dedicated geothermal permitting regimes separate from mineral mining
   - Establish centralized permitting offices to reduce duplicative reviews
   - **Potential impact:** 25-50% reduction in development timelines, 15-20x capacity increase by 2050

2. **Financial Parity:**
   - Extend tax credits and incentives to geothermal at levels comparable to wind and solar
   - Phase out fossil fuel subsidies that create market distortions
   - Establish risk mitigation mechanisms for early-stage exploration

3. **Institutional Coordination:**
   - Create interagency geothermal task forces at federal and state levels
   - Develop model regulatory frameworks that states can adopt
   - Strengthen international coordination for technology transfer and best practices

4. **Lobbying Reform:**
   - Increase transparency in energy sector lobbying activities
   - Consider policies to level the playing field between incumbent fossil fuel industries and emerging clean energy technologies
   - Support public awareness campaigns about geothermal benefits

5. **Workforce and Capacity Building:**
   - Invest in geothermal-specific academic programs and training
   - Leverage oil and gas industry expertise for geothermal development
   - Support international partnerships for knowledge exchange

## Conclusion

Political impediments—rather than technical or resource limitations—represent the primary barrier to widespread geothermal energy adoption. These barriers include:

1. **Regulatory fragmentation** leading to 8-year average development timelines
2. **Insufficient political will** despite growing bipartisan recognition of geothermal's potential
3. **Fossil fuel lobbying** that maintains policy advantages for incumbent technologies
4. **Subsidy imbalances** that disadvantage emerging geothermal technologies
5. **Poor intergovernmental coordination** creating duplicative and conflicting requirements
6. **Inconsistent international policy frameworks** limiting technology transfer and investment

**Success stories from Kenya, Iceland, and the Philippines** demonstrate that strong political commitment, consolidated governance, comprehensive policy frameworks, and sustained investment can overcome these barriers. However, these examples also show that policy frameworks alone are insufficient—implementation, enforcement, and long-term political stability are equally critical.

The recent bipartisan support for geothermal in the United States, driven partly by its alignment with oil and gas industry capabilities, presents a political opportunity. However, translating this support into concrete policy reforms—particularly in permitting, financial incentives, and institutional coordination—will determine whether geothermal realizes its potential as a major contributor to the clean energy transition.
