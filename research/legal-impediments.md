# Legal Impediments to Geothermal Energy Adoption: A Research Summary

## Executive Summary

This report examines the major legal and regulatory barriers impeding geothermal energy development in the United States and internationally. The research identifies seven critical legal impediments: property rights uncertainty, permitting complexity, environmental regulations, water rights conflicts, induced seismicity liability, transboundary resource issues, and regulatory uncertainty. These barriers significantly impact project timelines, costs, and investment decisions, with cumulative effects that can delay geothermal projects by years and increase costs substantially.

---

## Key Themes

### 1. Property Rights Ambiguity
The fundamental legal question of "who owns geothermal heat" remains unresolved in many jurisdictions, creating significant development uncertainty.

### 2. Regulatory Fragmentation
Multiple overlapping federal, state, and local permitting requirements create duplicative processes and extended timelines.

### 3. Environmental Review Burdens
NEPA and state-level environmental review processes can take years and invoke multiple assessments for single projects.

### 4. Water Law Conflicts
Geothermal resources intersect with water rights doctrines in complex and often contradictory ways.

### 5. Liability Uncertainty
Induced seismicity creates proportional liability concerns with unclear legal frameworks.

### 6. Cross-Border Complexity
Transboundary geothermal resources lack adequate international and interstate legal frameworks.

### 7. Investment Deterrence
Cumulative regulatory uncertainty discourages capital investment despite favorable economics.

## Major Findings by Topic

### Property Rights (Surface vs. Subsurface)

#### Core Issue: Ownership Uncertainty
The legal ownership of geothermal resources remains contested and varies significantly by jurisdiction. Unlike oil and gas, which have established property rights frameworks, geothermal energy's classification as a mineral, water resource, or sui generis resource varies by state.

**Key Findings:**
- **Texas (2023)**: Recent legislation (effective mid-2023) declared that surface rights holders own subsurface geothermal energy and associated resources, resolving decades of uncertainty (Society of Petroleum Engineers, 2023).
  
- **Classification Inconsistency**: Different states classify geothermal resources differently:
  - Some treat as minerals (requiring severed mineral rights)
  - Some treat as water resources (subject to appropriation doctrines)
  - Some treat as sui generis resources with unique regulatory frameworks
  
- **Eckstein's Analysis (2024)**: Recent scholarship argues that unclear property rights in geothermal heat significantly inhibit investment. The article "Who Owns Heat? Property Rights in Geothermal Energy" examines federal and state law, demonstrating inconsistent classifications and recommending legal clarity to unlock investment (Eckstein, 2024, Illinois Law Review).

- **Historical Precedent**: The Center for Energy Studies report (1977) noted that "until ownership questions are resolved for geothermal resources, their development will be inhibited in some degree, wherever they are located" — a problem that persists nearly 50 years later.

**Jurisdictional Variations:**
- **Federal Lands**: Geothermal resources on federal lands are governed by the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, treating them as distinct from minerals
- **Pennsylvania**: Recognizes severance of subsurface estates from surface estates (Eckert Seamans, 2025)
- **Utah**: Associates geothermal resources with nontributary groundwater, tying ownership to surface rights unless severed (Utah Legislature, 2025)

**Impact**: Property rights uncertainty creates:
- Title insurance challenges
- Difficulty securing financing
- Increased transaction costs
- Conflicts between surface and subsurface rights holders

### Permitting Complexity

#### Core Issue: Multi-Layered Approval Processes
Geothermal projects face numerous federal, state, and local permits across different development phases, creating cumulative delays and costs.

**Key Findings:**
- **NREL Analysis (2023)**: Permitting and regulatory requirements act as non-technical barriers affecting project timelines, costs, and risks. Each geothermal well on public land can invoke NEPA up to six times, with each Environmental Assessment (EA) taking approximately 10 months (NREL, 2023, "Non-Technical Barriers to Geothermal Development").

- **Eight-Year Average Timeline**: Research estimates an average development timeline of eight years for geothermal projects on public lands, largely due to permitting delays (ClearPath, 2024).

- **BLM Coordination Challenges**: The lack of a centralized permitting office at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) leads to duplicative environmental and regulatory assessments among local field offices (ClearPath, 2024).

- **Cost Impacts**: One analysis found levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) was 4-11% higher for projects with longer CEQA/NEPA review timelines compared to projects with the fastest review timelines (R Street Institute, 2024).

**Multiple Permit Types Required:**
- Land use permits
- Water quality and usage permits
- Species protection assessments
- Cultural resource impact studies
- Recreation impact assessments
- Air quality permits
- Well drilling permits
- Transmission interconnection approvals

**Recent Reform Efforts:**
- **2025 BLM Categorical Exclusions**: BLM proposed new categorical exclusions for geothermal exploration operations to expedite permitting (Federal Register, January 2025)
- **Emergency Authority**: DOI invoked emergency authority in June 2025 to accelerate certain geothermal projects for national security purposes

**Jurisdictional Challenges:**
- Federal lands involve BLM, Forest Service, and other agencies
- State agencies regulate environmental impacts
- Local governments control land use
- Tribal consultation required on certain lands

---

### Environmental Regulations

#### Core Issue: NEPA Compliance Burden
The National Environmental Policy Act creates significant procedural requirements that, while necessary for environmental protection, substantially extend project timelines.

**Key Findings:**
- **Multiple NEPA Reviews**: A single geothermal project can trigger up to six separate NEPA reviews as it progresses through exploration, development, and production phases (NREL estimates).

- **EA Timelines**: Environmental Assessments typically require 10 months to complete, while Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) can take multiple years (NREL/ClearPath analysis).

- **Legal Challenge Vulnerability**: Research from Resources for the Future (RFF) found that one of three geothermal projects completing an EIS faced NEPA-related court challenges, creating additional uncertainty and delay (RFF, "Taking Green Energy Projects to Court").

- **Categorical Exclusion Developments**: In January 2025, BLM proposed adding categorical exclusions specifically for geothermal exploration operations, potentially alleviating some NEPA burdens for initial project phases.

**State-Level Environmental Review:**
- **California CEQA**: California Environmental Quality Act adds state-level review on top of federal NEPA requirements
- **Combined Impact**: Projects facing both CEQA and NEPA review experience significantly higher costs and extended timelines

**Environmental Concerns Requiring Assessment:**
- Land use impacts and disturbance
- Water quality and availability
- Air quality (including hydrogen sulfide emissions)
- Wildlife and habitat protection (ESA compliance)
- Cultural and historic resources (NHPA compliance)
- Visual and noise impacts
- Induced seismicity risks
- Cumulative impacts with other projects

**Recent Policy Changes:**
- June 2025: DOI announced streamlined NEPA, ESA, and NHPA reviews for certain geothermal projects using emergency authority
- NEPA reforms under discussion to reduce timelines while maintaining environmental protections

---

### Water Rights

#### Core Issue: Intersection with Water Law Doctrines
Geothermal resources often involve water or steam, creating conflicts with established water rights systems, particularly in western states using prior appropriation doctrine.

**Key Findings:**
- **Prior Appropriation Conflicts**: Western states' "first in time, first in right" doctrine creates conflicts when geothermal development potentially impacts existing water rights holders (National Agricultural Law Center analysis).

- **Classification Ambiguity**: Whether geothermal resources constitute "water" for legal purposes varies by jurisdiction, affecting:
  - Permitting requirements
  - Appropriation rights
  - Beneficial use standards
  - Transfer and severance rules

- **Correlative Rights Doctrine**: Some states apply correlative rights (California) or absolute dominion rules to groundwater, creating different frameworks for geothermal development.

- **Beneficial Use Requirements**: Traditional water law requires "beneficial use," but geothermal energy production may not qualify in all jurisdictions, particularly for direct-use applications.

**Specific Conflicts:**
- **Consumptive Use**: Geothermal systems that consume water face appropriation challenges
- **Return Flow**: Binary systems that reinject water face different requirements than systems with surface discharge
- **Temperature Changes**: Reinjection of cooled water may impact thermal characteristics of aquifers
- **Aquifer Drawdown**: Geothermal production can lower water tables, affecting senior water rights holders

**Jurisdictional Approaches:**
- **Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado**: Apply prior appropriation doctrine to geothermal as groundwater
- **California**: Uses correlative rights for groundwater, creating different allocation framework
- **Montana**: Strict prior appropriation with priority dates determining rights
- **Texas**: Recent legislation clarified geothermal as separate from traditional water rights

**Case Law Limitations**: Limited judicial precedent exists for geothermal-water conflicts, creating uncertainty in dispute resolution.

### Liability for Induced Seismicity

#### Core Issue: Uncertain Legal Framework for Earthquake Liability
Geothermal operations can induce seismicity, but legal liability frameworks remain underdeveloped, creating risk management challenges.

**Key Findings:**
- **Cypser & Davis Framework (1998)**: Foundational article "Induced seismicity and the potential for liability under U.S. law" identified that seismicity from one source might accelerate failure from another source, leaving both parties proportionally liable (Cypser & Davis, 1998, Tectonophysics).

- **Proportional Liability Complexity**: When induced seismicity from multiple operations (e.g., geothermal and wastewater injection) combine, determining fault proportions becomes legally and scientifically challenging.

- **Insurance Gaps**: Traditional insurance policies may not cover induced seismicity damages, and specialized coverage remains limited and expensive (Zhou et al., 2024, Reviews of Geophysics).

- **DOE Protocol (2012)**: The Department of Energy developed a "Protocol for Addressing Induced Seismicity Associated with Enhanced Geothermal Systems" providing technical guidance but limited legal clarity (DOE, 2012).

**Legal Theories Applied:**
- **Strict Liability**: Some jurisdictions may apply strict liability for ultra-hazardous activities
- **Negligence**: Operators must follow industry standards and monitoring protocols
- **Nuisance**: Induced earthquakes causing damage may constitute nuisance
- **Trespass**: Subsurface fracturing extending beyond property boundaries

**Risk Management Requirements:**
- Pre-operational seismic monitoring to establish baseline
- Real-time monitoring during operations
- Traffic light protocols (green-yellow-red thresholds)
- Public communication strategies
- Insurance or collateral funds
- Damage assessment and compensation schemes

**International Precedents:**
- **Switzerland & Germany**: Public and political reactions to induced earthquakes have determined project continuation (Kassem et al., 2025)
- **European Projects**: Several EGS projects suspended or cancelled due to induced seismicity concerns

**Regulatory Gaps:**
- No federal legislation specifically addresses induced seismicity liability for geothermal
- State regulations vary widely in monitoring and response requirements
- Damage compensation mechanisms remain ad hoc

### Cross-Border and Transboundary Resources

#### Core Issue: Inadequate Legal Frameworks for Shared Resources
Geothermal reservoirs often cross political boundaries, but legal frameworks for managing transboundary resources remain primitive.

**Key Findings:**
- **Underdeveloped International Law**: The law applicable to transboundary groundwater resources (including geothermal) at both international and subnational levels is "presently quite primitive and lacking" (The Groundwater Project, 2025).

- **Bédaride & Gambardella Analysis (2021)**: Chapter on "Deep geothermal energy versus transboundary environmental protection" examines challenges of developing deep geothermal projects in cross-border contexts, highlighting legal obstacles in defining acceptable risk and environmental protection (published in Taylor & Francis collection, 2021).

- **Interstate Conflicts**: Within the U.S., geothermal resources crossing state boundaries lack clear allocation frameworks, unlike interstate water compacts.

- **International Investment Protection**: Cross-border geothermal developments involve international arbitration for investment protection, but specific sector guidance remains limited.

**Key Legal Challenges:**
- **Sovereignty Issues**: Subsurface resource extraction beneath neighboring territory
- **Rule of Capture**: Traditional rule may allow one nation/state to drain shared reservoir
- **Benefit Sharing**: No established frameworks for sharing economic benefits
- **Environmental Responsibility**: Unclear liability when operations in one jurisdiction cause harm across borders
- **Monitoring Coordination**: Technical monitoring across boundaries requires legal agreements

**Existing Legal Instruments (Limited Application):**
- **UN Watercourses Convention**: Applies to surface water and some groundwater but unclear application to geothermal
- **USGS/UNESCO Guidelines**: Provide technical but not legal frameworks for transboundary groundwater management
- **Bilateral Agreements**: Some exist (e.g., US-Mexico) but rarely address geothermal specifically

**Case Study Implications:**
- **Imperial Valley (US-Mexico)**: Cerro Prieto geothermal field extends across border, creating allocation questions
- **Alsace Region (France-Germany-Switzerland)**: Requires trilateral coordination for geothermal development
- **East African Rift**: Multiple nations share geothermal resources without coordination frameworks

### Regulatory Uncertainty

#### Core Issue: Policy Instability Deters Investment
Inconsistent policies, frequent regulatory changes, and lack of coordination among government agencies create investment uncertainty.

**Key Findings:**
- **NYSERDA Report (2021)**: Study on "Overcoming Legal and Regulatory Barriers to District Geothermal in NY" found that property rights and permitting uncertainty "raise the cost and uncertainty of district geothermal systems, resulting in net diseconomies of scale" (NYSERDA, 2021).

- **Indonesia Case Study**: Policy instability, including tariff revisions, creates uncertainty and deters investment in developing countries (Springer, 2025, Sustainable Energy Research).

- **Tax Equity Complexity**: Tax equity investments for geothermal are legally complex, limiting investor base to large institutions. Credit Suisse found just three banks accounted for over half of US tax equity investments (IFP analysis, 2024).

- **Ministerial Conflicts**: Lack of coordination among government ministries and between central and local governments creates policy conflicts (ScienceDirect, 2024).

- **Financing Constraints**: Regulatory uncertainty combines with financing barriers to significantly impact project viability (Niskanen Center, 2025).

**Types of Regulatory Uncertainty:**
1. **Classification Uncertainty**: Whether geothermal is mineral, water, or sui generis
2. **Permitting Pathway Uncertainty**: Which agency has primary jurisdiction
3. **Timeline Uncertainty**: Unpredictable review and approval durations
4. **Standard Uncertainty**: Evolving environmental and technical standards
5. **Policy Continuity**: Changes with political administrations

**Economic Impacts:**
- Increased cost of capital due to perceived risk
- Difficulty obtaining project finance
- Extended development timelines
- Reduced investor interest compared to other renewables
- Higher transaction costs for legal and regulatory compliance

**Sector Comparisons:**
- **Solar/Wind**: Benefit from streamlined interconnection and established permitting pathways
- **Oil & Gas**: Established frameworks despite environmental concerns
- **Geothermal**: Lacks consistent treatment, facing novel legal questions at each project

**Reform Proposals:**
- Centralized federal permitting coordination
- State-level model statutes
- Memoranda of understanding between agencies
- Threshold MW requirements to trigger federal review (currently debated)
- Investment tax credit parity with other renewables

## Conclusion

Legal impediments to geothermal energy adoption are substantial, multifaceted, and interconnected. Property rights uncertainty creates foundational barriers that ripple through financing and development decisions. Permitting complexity and environmental review requirements, while serving important protective functions, extend timelines to economically challenging lengths. Water rights conflicts remain unresolved in many jurisdictions. Induced seismicity liability frameworks lag behind technological advancement. Transboundary resources lack adequate legal governance. Regulatory uncertainty pervades all aspects of development, deterring investment despite favorable economics.

These barriers are not insurmountable. Recent legislative reforms (Texas 2023, New York 2024), regulatory streamlining efforts (BLM categorical exclusions 2025), and growing academic attention to property rights questions suggest momentum toward legal clarity. However, comprehensive reform—potentially including federal legislation, interstate compacts, international treaties, and fundamental property rights clarification—will be necessary to unlock geothermal energy's full potential as a baseload renewable resource.

The cumulative effect of these legal impediments is significant: increased costs (4-11% LCOE increases documented), extended timelines (8-year averages on federal lands), and reduced investment compared to other renewables. As governments pursue decarbonization goals, addressing these legal barriers should be prioritized to enable geothermal's unique contribution to reliable, zero-carbon energy systems.
