# Social Impediments to Geothermal Energy Adoption: A Research Summary

**Compiled:** February 5, 2026  
**Focus Areas:** Public perception, community acceptance, NIMBY effects, environmental justice, indigenous rights, land use conflicts, workforce/employment impacts

---

## Executive Summary

Social barriers represent significant impediments to geothermal energy deployment, often equal to or exceeding technical and financial challenges. Key impediments include: lack of public awareness and trust, NIMBY opposition driven by seismic risk concerns, conflicts with cultural and spiritual values (particularly hot springs and sacred sites), inadequate community engagement and benefit-sharing mechanisms, and environmental justice concerns regarding marginalized communities. Successful geothermal development requires addressing social license to operate through transparency, early stakeholder engagement, equitable benefit distribution, and respect for indigenous rights and cultural values.

## Key Themes

### 1. **Lack of Awareness and Knowledge Deficits**

**Major Finding:** Public and political lack of awareness about geothermal energy is the most fundamental barrier, affecting risk perception, investment decisions, and community acceptance.

**Evidence:**
- **East Africa:** Study found that lack of awareness prevents politicians and developers from taking risks and negatively affects local community risk perception (Oxford Academic, 2024)
- **General observation:** Acceptance problems in different social sectors stem from lack of knowledge and negative perceptions that can affect development of energy technologies (Bertani, 2016; Dowd et al., cited in Geothermal Energy Journal, 2021)
- Knowledge deficits exist at multiple levels: general public, local communities, decision-makers, and even among investors and policymakers

### 2. **NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) Opposition**

**Major Finding:** NIMBY syndrome is a persistent challenge where communities may support renewable energy in principle but oppose projects in their locality due to perceived risks and impacts.

**Key Mechanisms:**
- Local residents tend to be very objectionable when geothermal extraction activities are nearby (IIETA, 2022)
- Opposition often stems from fears about environmental impacts, seismic risks, property values, and disruption of established local activities
- NIMBY resistance has led to project delays or cancellations across multiple countries

**Case Studies:**

**Japan:** 
- Hot spring (onsen) resort owners have blocked geothermal development for decades, fearing depletion of thermal water resources despite different drilling depths (New York Times, 2023; ABC News, 2023)
- Town of Kusatsu passed ordinance requiring proof that projects won't negatively affect hot springs (The Spectator, 2024)
- Success story: Obama Hot Springs in Unzen developed community consensus through extensive outreach, formation of local councils with spa owners as voting members (Tokyo Foundation)

**Korea (Pohang):**
- 2017 Mw 5.4 earthquake near Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) project caused $52 million in damage, injured 90 people (Science/AAAS)
- Proximity to epicenter negatively correlated with public preference for geothermal energy post-earthquake (Baek et al., 2021)
- Local residents anchored geothermal risk to nuclear power plant risks following the earthquake (PubMed, 2021)

**Switzerland:**
- Basel EGS project terminated after ML 3.4 induced earthquake in 2006 (Wikipedia; Deichmann & Giardini, 2009)
- Project cancellation in December 2009 following seismic hazard evaluation

**France:**
- Strasbourg deep geothermal project terminated due to ML 3.6 induced earthquake (Zhou et al., 2024, Reviews of Geophysics)

**United States:**
- MIT researchers identified 53 utility-scale wind, solar, and geothermal projects delayed or blocked between 2008-2021 (Generation Investment Management)

### 3. **Seismic Risk Concerns and Induced Seismicity**

**Major Finding:** Fear of induced earthquakes represents one of the most significant public acceptance barriers, particularly for Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS).

**Technical Context:**
- Fluid injection for reservoir stimulation can induce seismicity by changing subsurface stress conditions
- Most induced events are imperceptible, but rare larger magnitude events have caused damage and public alarm
- Post-injection shutdown period can be particularly risky for larger events

**Public Perception Issues:**
- Seismicity concerns are often cited alongside water usage and pollution as primary risks (Layton et al., 1981; Dowd et al., 2011; Reith et al., 2013)
- Communities in seismically active regions show heightened sensitivity
- Risk communication failures amplify public fears
- Media coverage of induced events creates lasting negative perceptions

**Notable Incidents:**
- **Pohang, South Korea (2017):** Largest documented geothermal-induced earthquake (Mw 5.4), though debate continues about whether it was induced, triggered, or natural (ScienceDirect, 2022)
- **Basel, Switzerland (2006):** ML 3.4 event led to project suspension and eventual cancellation
- **Strasbourg, France:** ML 3.6 event caused project termination (Schmittbuhl et al., 2021)
- **St. Gallen, Switzerland (2013):** M 3.5 event associated with geothermal project

### 4. **Trust Deficits and Institutional Credibility**

**Major Finding:** Lack of trust in public institutions, developers, media, and scientific information creates fundamental barriers to social acceptance.

**Key Issues:**
- **Chile (Araucanía region):** Study highlighted lack of trust, spiritual relationship to volcanoes, and uncertainty about environmental impact as key social barriers (Villalobos et al., 2018)
- **General pattern:** Trust erosion stems from perceived lack of transparency, inadequate community engagement, and broken promises from previous projects
- Distrust of public institutions compounds community skepticism
- Media sensationalism of risks undermines balanced understanding

---

### 5. **Indigenous Rights and Cultural/Spiritual Concerns**

**Major Finding:** Geothermal resources often overlap with indigenous territories and sacred sites, creating conflicts when development proceeds without proper consultation, respect for cultural values, and equitable benefit-sharing.

**New Zealand (Māori):**
- Māori hold deep spiritual and cultural connections to geothermal features (wai tapu - sacred waters)
- Historical loss of control: Māori tribal groups held full rangatiratanga (control/authority) over resources prior to European settlement; settler government undermined this control (ScienceDirect, 1992)
- **Success model:** Modern co-management approaches where Māori receive project stakes and benefits have enabled development with social license (Springer, 2025)
- New Zealand law now requires assessment of Māori values impacts in geothermal utilization (ScienceDirect, 2023)
- Volcanic craters, crater lakes, geothermal springs are considered tapu (sacred/forbidden) and protected through Māori knowledge systems (Journal of Applied Volcanology, 2015)

**Taiwan (Indigenous Communities):**
- Developers exploited loopholes by leasing private land to bypass Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) procedures
- Many projects were small enough to evade Environmental Impact Assessment requirements
- Resource conflicts and procedural disputes prompted collective community action (Grassroots Journal, 2022)

**General Indigenous Rights Issues:**
- Conflict between indigenous peoples' right to self-determination and environmental development obligations
- Climate change and geothermal development on traditional lands threaten cultural survival
- Calls for "indigenous right to environmental self-determination" to maintain cultural and political status (Tsosie, Colorado Law Review, 2007)
- Settler-colonialism continues as driving force behind deterioration of Native lands (Nonprofit Quarterly, 2024)

**Kenya (Maasai):**
- Olkaria V project protests by Maasai residents halted construction when community consent was not adequately obtained (Springer, 2025)
- Illustrates practical risks of proceeding without genuine local buy-in

---

### 6. **Environmental Justice Concerns**

**Major Finding:** Without targeted measures, historically marginalized communities risk bearing disproportionate burdens from geothermal development while receiving fewer benefits.

**Key Issues:**
- Marginalized communities (racial/ethnic minorities, low-income populations, indigenous peoples) have historically faced disproportionate environmental burdens
- Renewable energy transition risks replicating historical patterns of environmental injustice if equity not prioritized
- Justice40 initiative (U.S.): Aims to deliver 40% of climate/clean energy investment benefits to disadvantaged communities (DOI, DOE)
- Environmental justice requires: distributive justice (fair allocation of benefits/burdens), procedural justice (meaningful participation), and recognition justice (acknowledging diverse values and rights)

**Procedural Justice Gaps:**
- Inadequate community participation in decision-making
- Language and accessibility barriers in public consultation processes
- Short timelines for community input on complex technical projects
- Power imbalances between well-resourced developers and community groups

**Distributive Justice Concerns:**
- Local communities may bear environmental and social disruptions while energy benefits flow elsewhere
- Employment opportunities may go to outside workers rather than local residents
- Revenue generation may not translate to community improvements

### 7. **Land Use Conflicts**

**Major Finding:** Competition for land and resources creates conflicts between geothermal development and existing economic activities, particularly agriculture and tourism.

**Japan Hot Springs Conflict:**
- Multi-billion dollar onsen industry sees geothermal as existential threat
- Tourism-dependent communities fear loss of iconic hot spring attractions
- Cultural significance of bathing tradition adds non-economic dimension
- Power asymmetry: organized onsen lobby versus dispersed renewable energy advocates
- Despite different resource depths (hot springs vs. geothermal reservoirs), fear of interconnection persists

**Agricultural Disruptions:**
- Geothermal development can displace farmland and grazing areas
- Concerns about contamination of agricultural water sources
- Changes to local microclimates or hydrology affecting crop yields

**Tourism Trade-offs:**
- Scenic value concerns: visibility of power plants, steam plumes, infrastructure
- Noise during drilling and construction
- Potential loss of "pristine" nature tourism appeal
- Some regions successfully integrate geothermal into tourism narrative (Iceland, New Zealand hot pools)

**Residential Proximity Issues:**
- Property value concerns near geothermal sites
- Quality of life impacts: noise, traffic, visual changes
- Odor from hydrogen sulfide emissions at some sites

**Citations:**
> Kubota, H., Hondo, H., Hienuki, S., & Kaieda, H. (2013). "Determining barriers to developing geothermal power generation in Japan: societal acceptance by stakeholders involved in hot springs." *Energy Policy*.

---

### 8. **Workforce and Employment Impacts**

**Major Finding:** While geothermal creates employment opportunities, workforce development challenges and questions about job quality, local hiring, and equitable access persist.

**Positive Employment Impacts:**
- Direct job creation across project lifecycle: exploration, drilling, construction, operations, maintenance
- Operations and maintenance generate more long-term employment than construction
- Indirect/induced jobs in supply chains and local economies
- Study in Poland: More jobs generated in geothermal municipalities than reference areas (Kurek & Heijman, 2021)
- Geothermal can provide economic diversification for rural communities

**Workforce Challenges:**
- **Skill shortages:** Industry faces deficits in high-skilled positions (ESMAP, 2023)
- **Training gaps:** Need for expanded educational programs, mentorships, apprenticeships, internships
- **Local hiring barriers:** Specialized skills may require bringing in outside workforce
- **Temporary vs. permanent:** Construction jobs temporary, while O&M jobs are long-term but fewer in number
- **Equity concerns:** Ensuring opportunities reach women, youth, and marginalized groups

**Community Benefit Considerations:**
- Need for community benefits agreements (CBAs) ensuring tangible local benefits beyond jobs
- Skills training programs for local workforce
- Support for local businesses in supply chains
- Revenue sharing arrangements

## Major Case Studies

### 1. **Pohang, South Korea (2017)**

**Context:** Enhanced Geothermal System pilot project in seismically active region

**Incident:** November 15, 2017 - Mw 5.4 earthquake, epicenter 600m from EGS site
- Second-largest earthquake in modern South Korean history
- 90 injuries, $52 million in damage
- Scientific debate: induced vs. triggered vs. natural, but government investigation concluded geothermal connection

**Social Impacts:**
- Dramatic shift in public perception, particularly locally
- Geothermal acceptance collapsed in local communities near epicenter
- National vs. local divergence: general public maintained more positive view than affected residents
- Residents cognitively anchored geothermal risk to nuclear power plant risks
- Effectively halted EGS development ambitions in Korea

**Lessons:**
- Induced seismicity remains largest social acceptance risk for EGS
- Geographic proximity to risk strongly influences perception
- Single high-profile incident can undermine entire technology acceptance
- Critical importance of rigorous seismic hazard assessment and monitoring

### 2. **Japan Hot Springs (Onsen) Conflict**

**Context:** Japan has 3rd largest geothermal potential globally but ranks far below in installed capacity

**Conflict:** Multi-decade standoff between renewable energy advocates and onsen (hot spring) industry
- 27,000+ hot springs supporting tourism economy
- Cultural tradition dating back centuries
- Onsen owners fear geothermal drilling will deplete hot spring water
- Different depths: hot springs typically <500m, geothermal wells 1,000-3,000m

**Barriers:**
- Institutional: onsen lobby has political influence, local ordinances blocking development
- Cultural: bathing tradition central to Japanese identity
- Economic: tourism-dependent communities see geothermal as threat not opportunity
- Trust: skepticism of industry assurances about different water sources

**Breakthrough Examples:**
- **Obama, Nagasaki:** Extensive community outreach, formation of local council with spa owners as voting members, financial/technical support from universities and government (Tokyo Foundation)
- **Nakao Geothermal Plant, Okuhida:** Opened December 2022, using steam from hot spring reservoirs with community buy-in

**Lessons:**
- Long-term stakeholder engagement essential
- Need for trusted intermediaries (universities, local government)
- Financial incentives and benefit-sharing arrangements
- Technical education to address misconceptions
- Patience: consensus-building takes years

### 4. **New Zealand Māori Co-Management Model**

**Context:** New Zealand has substantial Māori land ownership and strong indigenous rights framework

**Approach:**
- Legal requirement to assess impacts on Māori values (mauri - life force)
- Treaty settlements provided financial compensation, land transfers, and in some cases geothermal well ownership
- Co-management arrangements with iwi (tribes)
- Revenue-sharing partnerships
- Incorporation of mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) in resource management

**Success Factors:**
- Legal recognition of indigenous rights and Treaty of Waitangi obligations
- Meaningful partnership, not just consultation
- Economic stake in projects for Māori communities
- Respect for cultural values and tapu (sacred) sites
- Long-term relationship building

**Challenges:**
- Tensions remain between development and conservation of culturally significant geothermal features
- Ongoing negotiation of balance between economic development and cultural preservation
- Need for culturally appropriate indicators and thresholds

**Lessons:**
- Indigenous partnership model can achieve social license
- Equitable benefit-sharing crucial
- Cultural impact assessment must be meaningful, not perfunctory
- Long-term commitment to relationship, not transactional approach

## Social License to Operate (SLO) Framework

**Concept:** Social license to operate refers to ongoing acceptance of a project by local communities and stakeholders based on trust, legitimacy, and credibility.

**SLO Levels (Thomson & Boutilier Model):**
1. **Withdrawal:** Active opposition, project cannot proceed
2. **Acceptance:** Grudging tolerance, minimal approval
3. **Approval:** Ongoing acceptance based on perceived benefits
4. **Co-ownership:** Psychological identification with project, advocacy, project part of local identity

**Key Elements for Building SLO:**
- **Trust:** Honesty, reliability, competence, concern for community wellbeing
- **Transparency:** Open communication about risks, benefits, uncertainties
- **Procedural justice:** Fair, inclusive decision-making processes
- **Distributive justice:** Equitable sharing of benefits and burdens
- **Mutual respect:** Valuing local knowledge, culture, concerns
- **Dialogue:** Two-way communication, not one-way information provision
- **Responsiveness:** Demonstrating that community input influences decisions

**Application to Geothermal:**
- SLO especially important given long project timelines (exploration through decommissioning)
- Must be continually earned and maintained, not achieved once
- Different stakeholders may grant/withhold SLO at different levels
- Loss of SLO can halt projects even if legal permits obtained

## Conclusions

Social impediments to geothermal energy adoption are diverse, context-specific, and often more challenging to overcome than technical barriers. Key findings:

1. **Awareness is foundational:** Public and political knowledge deficits undermine all other acceptance factors

2. **Trust is paramount:** Without trust in operators, institutions, and information sources, technical solutions to risk cannot overcome social barriers

3. **One size does not fit all:** Effective strategies must be tailored to local contexts, cultures, values, and concerns

4. **Induced seismicity is the "Achilles heel":** Remains the most potent social acceptance barrier for EGS technology

5. **Indigenous and cultural rights must be respected:** Geothermal development overlapping with indigenous territories or sacred sites requires partnership, not imposition

6. **Procedural and distributive justice matter:** How decisions are made and how benefits/burdens are distributed fundamentally affect social license

7. **Long-term commitment required:** Social license must be continually earned through actions, not just words

8. **Success is possible:** Case studies demonstrate that with appropriate strategies, geothermal development can achieve and maintain social acceptance

**Path Forward:**
Sustainable geothermal development requires embedding social considerations from the earliest planning stages, investing in relationship-building and trust, ensuring equitable benefit-sharing, respecting cultural values and indigenous rights, managing risks transparently, and maintaining ongoing dialogue with all affected stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.
