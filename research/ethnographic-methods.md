**Research compiled:** February 5, 2026  
**Focus:** Social acceptance, barriers, and community engagement in geothermal energy development

---

## 1. Overview of Qualitative Geothermal Research

### Current State of the Field

Qualitative and ethnographic methods have emerged as critical approaches for understanding social acceptance and adoption barriers for geothermal energy projects. A **systematic review by Reno et al. (2023)** published in *Energy, Sustainability and Society* analyzed social acceptance studies globally, finding that:

- **Mixed methods predominate**: Most studies combine qualitative and quantitative approaches (interviews + surveys)
- **Geographic concentration**: Studies primarily focus on Europe (Switzerland, Italy, Germany), Asia (Japan, Philippines, Indonesia), Latin America (Chile), East Africa (Kenya, Ethiopia), and Australia
- **Key finding**: Integration of all relevant stakeholder groups strongly influences social acceptance outcomes
- **Common barriers identified**: Lack of community awareness, trust deficits, perceived environmental risks, cultural/spiritual concerns, and exclusion from decision-making

### Methodological Trends

Qualitative geothermal research has evolved from simple surveys to sophisticated ethnographic and participatory methods:

1. **Semi-structured interviews** (most common)
2. **Focus group discussions**
3. **Participant observation and ethnographic fieldwork**
4. **Case study research designs**
5. **Deliberative engagement methods** (citizen juries, participatory action research)
6. **Document analysis** (EIA reports, media coverage, policy documents)
7. **Mixed methods** (qualitative + quantitative integration)

**Analytical frameworks employed:**
- Thematic analysis
- Directed content analysis
- Grounded theory approaches
- Discourse and narrative analysis
- Framework analysis
- Critical discourse analysis (CDA)

- Narrative analysis (how stories are told)
- Frame analysis (how issues are presented)

---

### **G. Analytical Frameworks**

#### **Thematic Analysis**
**Most widely reported analytical approach**

**Process:**
1. Familiarization with data (reading/re-reading transcripts)

## 5. Gaps in the Literature

### **A. Geographic Gaps**

**Under-researched regions:**
1. **Africa** (outside East Africa)
   - West Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa
   - Nigeria study (2025) is rare exception

2. **Middle East**
   - Despite geothermal potential (Turkey studied, but limited qualitative work)

3. **Southeast Asia** (partial coverage)
   - Indonesia well-studied
   - Philippines has some research
   - Limited: Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia

4. **Central Asia and South Asia**
   - Minimal qualitative research

5. **Latin America** (uneven coverage)
   - Chile well-studied
   - Limited: Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina
   - Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua: mostly policy analysis, not ethnographic

6. **North America**
   - Limited community-based qualitative studies in U.S. and Canada

---

### **B. Methodological Gaps**

**1. Longitudinal ethnographic studies are rare**
   - Ricker's 7-month Kenya study is exceptional
   - Most studies: 1-2 months or single time-point interviews
   - **Need:** Multi-year ethnographic studies tracking projects from exploration to operation

**2. Limited true participant observation**
   - Most studies rely primarily on interviews and focus groups
   - Few researchers embed in communities long-term
   - **Need:** More immersive ethnography

**3. Visual and sensory methods underutilized**
   - Iceland cross-cultural visual ethnography project is innovative
   - Potential: photovoice, video ethnography, participatory mapping
   - **Need:** Multi-sensory ethnographic approaches

**4. Indigenous research methodologies**
   - Studies WITH indigenous communities, not just ABOUT them
   - Chile Araucanía begins this, but more needed
   - **Need:** Indigenous-led research, community-based participatory research

**5. Action research and intervention studies**
   - Most studies are observational
   - **Need:** More PAR, evaluation of participation interventions

**6. Digital ethnography**
   - Online community discussions, social media analysis
   - Especially relevant for distributed stakeholder networks
   - **Need:** Mixed online-offline ethnographic methods

---

### **C. Topical Gaps**

**1. Inter-generational perspectives**
   - Age mentioned as variable, but limited intergenerational analysis
   - **Need:** Youth perspectives, elder knowledge, generational conflict

**2. Class and socioeconomic diversity**
   - Within-community heterogeneity often flattened
   - **Need:** Attention to economic stratification, land ownership patterns

**3. Disability and accessibility**
   - Virtually absent from literature
   - **Need:** Inclusive research on energy access for people with disabilities

**4. Migration and mobility**
   - Displacement studied (Kenya), but broader migration dynamics understudied
   - **Need:** How does geothermal development affect migration patterns?

**5. Emotional and affective dimensions**
   - Risk perception studied, but not embodied experience
   - **Need:** Affective ethnography, emotional geographies of energy

**6. Non-human dimensions**
   - Animals, ecosystems, spiritual beings (e.g., volcano deities)
   - **Need:** Multispecies ethnography, more-than-human geographies

**7. Success stories**
   - Bias toward conflict and opposition in literature
   - **Need:** Ethnographies of successful community-developer partnerships

**8. Everyday energy practices**
   - Focus on acceptance/rejection, less on daily energy use
   - **Need:** Practice-oriented ethnography of energy transitions

---

### **D. Theoretical Gaps**

**1. Limited engagement with critical theory**
   - Ricker's Feminist Political Ecology is notable exception
   - **Need:** Postcolonial theory, critical race theory, indigenous epistemologies

**2. Weak integration with Science and Technology Studies (STS)**
   - Energy transitions literature largely separate from social acceptance studies
   - **Need:** STS concepts: sociotechnical imaginaries, co-production, ontological politics

**3. Insufficient attention to power and political economy**
   - Micro-level community focus without macro-structural analysis
   - **Need:** Multi-scalar analysis linking local barriers to global energy regimes

**4. Lack of comparative theoretical frameworks**
   - Case studies accumulate, but weak cross-case theorization
   - **Need:** Comparative ethnography with robust theoretical synthesis

---

### **E. Practical and Policy Gaps**

**1. Translation to practice**
   - Academic studies don't always reach practitioners
   - **Need:** Co-production of knowledge with developers, policymakers

**2. Evaluation of engagement interventions**
   - Many studies recommend "better engagement," but few evaluate specific strategies
   - **Need:** Comparative evaluation of participation models

**3. Long-term follow-up**
   - What happens AFTER initial acceptance or rejection?
   - **Need:** Studies tracking projects 5, 10, 20 years post-development

**4. Benefit-sharing mechanisms**
   - Mentioned as important, but limited ethnographic analysis of how they work (or don't)
   - **Need:** Ethnographies of community benefit agreements, revenue sharing

---

### **F. Sample Size and Rigor Documentation Gaps**

**Issue:** Many studies don't clearly report:
- Sampling strategy (convenience, purposive, theoretical, snowball)
- Sample characteristics (demographics, selection criteria)
- Saturation assessment
- Interview duration
- Coding process details
- Inter-coder reliability (if team-based)
- Reflexivity statements

**Need:** Better methodological transparency and reporting standards for qualitative geothermal research

---

## 6. Methodological Recommendations for Future Research

- Medium projects: 15-30 interviews
- Large/comprehensive: 40-50 interviews
- Kenya study: 46 household + 5 key informant (51 total) - robust

**Focus groups:**
- Typically: 4-8 groups
- Switzerland: 6 groups
- Varies by project scope

**Ethnographic fieldwork:**
- Minimum: 1-3 months
- Robust: 6-12 months (Kenya: 7 months)
- Ideal: Multi-year with repeated visits

### **Best Practices Identified**

1. **Triangulation:** Multiple methods (interviews + focus groups + observation + documents)
2. **Stakeholder diversity:** Residents, developers, government, NGOs, indigenous leaders
3. **Gender-disaggregated data:** Separate men's/women's groups, gender analysis
4. **Local language:** Interviews in mother tongue with professional translation
5. **Iterative design:** Allow themes to guide additional data collection
6. **Member checking:** Share preliminary findings with participants
7. **Reflexivity:** Researcher positionality statement, acknowledgment of biases
8. **Ethical review:** Institutional approval, informed consent, confidentiality

## 8. Conclusions: The Value of Ethnographic Approaches

**Ethnographic and qualitative methods uniquely contribute to geothermal energy research by:**

1. **Revealing hidden barriers** that surveys miss (cultural, spiritual, emotional)
2. **Capturing power dynamics** and exclusion in decision-making
3. **Understanding local context** essential for project success
4. **Centering community voices** often marginalized in technical assessments
5. **Identifying pathways** for meaningful participation and benefit-sharing
6. **Documenting lived experiences** of displacement, disruption, and change
7. **Informing better practice** through rich, contextualized insights

**The field is maturing** with more rigorous ethnographic studies (Kenya), better theoretical grounding (Feminist Political Ecology), and innovative methods (citizen juries, visual ethnography). However, **significant geographic and methodological gaps remain**, particularly:
- Need for more longitudinal studies
- Greater engagement with indigenous communities as co-researchers
- Expansion beyond Europe, Japan, and select case studies
- Integration of critical theories and power analysis

**For practitioners and policymakers:** These studies demonstrate that social acceptance is not a problem to overcome, but a complex, context-dependent process requiring genuine engagement, cultural sensitivity, equitable benefit-sharing, and long-term relationship-building. Ethnographic research shows us **how** to do this well—and the consequences when we don't.
